🎥 Vid2TextQ&A
Vid2TextQ&A is an intelligent Python-based project that bridges computer vision and natural language processing to extract meaningful insights from videos. This application leverages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and transformer-based NLP models to read text from video frames and intelligently answer user questions based on that extracted content.

🚀 What It Does
📸 Extracts frames from video files using OpenCV.
🔍 Applies Tesseract OCR to detect and extract text from each frame.
📄 Consolidates extracted text for contextual understanding.
❓ Allows users to ask questions about the content seen in the video.
🧠 Processes user queries using pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT or RoBERTa) to return accurate and context-aware answers.

🌟 Key Features
🎞️ Video-to-frame conversion using OpenCV.
🧾 Text extraction from each frame using Tesseract OCR.
🧠 Contextual understanding of the text using Hugging Face Transformers.
❓ Interactive question answering interface (text-based).
💡 Useful for automated learning from tutorials, lectures, explainer videos, and more.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV – For video processing and frame extraction
